# Ergodicity Economics lecture notes
Lecture notes, published through our blog.



Questions we're interested in: 
* Part I, Tools, is meant to provide readers with required background, a bag of tricks. We want to keep this short because we're not writing a book on probability theory etc. 
Is anything unclear in this section? Is something essential missing?
* Both in Part I and Part II: where would figures help, what should they be?
* should we link to animations? code? Good ideas for how to do that?
* errors, typos, notational inconsistency -- please let us know.


## Changelog

### 28 November 2019
Part I and Part II, up to chapter 5, have been updated since June 2018. We're currently working on them.
