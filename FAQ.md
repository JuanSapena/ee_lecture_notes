# Frequently Asked Questions

Ergodic Economics shows that finance is based on a 350 years old, incomplete, and erroneous model. To provide recommendations the traditional model requires additional, external, and unreliable inputs such as psychological preferences.

The historical development of the traditional model created a succession of patches around this old, incomplete, and erroneous foundation. Departures or disagreements with the model are labeled as puzzles, paradoxes, anomalies, and irrational behavior.

Ergodic Economics fixes the erroneous foundation, works alongside the traditional model, and transcends its results. Ergodic Economics provides recommendations from inside the model, and resolves the puzzles, paradoxes, anomalies, and irrationalities.

What are the differences between the following EE objects:
-	 a gambleâ€™s multiplier and a rate of return?
-	 a rate of return and a growth rate?
-	 a geometric average and a time average?
-	 a multiplier, a rate of return, and an ergodic growth rate?

If ergodic growth rates are normally distributed:
-	Are time averages log-normally distributed?
-	Are ensemble averages normally distributed?
-	Are rates of returns log-normally distributed?
-	Are gamble multipliers log-normally distributed? 
-	Are the underlying prices log-normally distributed?

What is the list of puzzles, paradoxes, and anomalies that can be explained by EE?
-	The St. Petersburg paradox
-	The paradox of Insurance
-	The Equity Premium Puzzle
-	The Puzzle of Cooperation
-	The Puzzle of Inequality

What is the list of Laws and Theories that can be improved by EE?
-	EMH
o	Growth implies Noise, obviating the need for the information narrative engineering
-	MPT
o	Make direct allocation recommendations without references to psychological preferences
-	CAPM
o	Replace Sharpe Ratio with the Optimal Leverage Ratio?

What is the structure of quantifiable price risk in EE, and it is different from the one in EMH?
-	Does variance grow with the square root of time in GBM?
-	Can EE calculate the maximum ergodic growth rate beyond which noise makes the system unstable?
-	What does the EE perspective add to the explanation that CLT normalizes the distribution characteristics of the ensemble average as contrasted with the potentially non-normal characteristics of the underlying distributions?
