# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Ergodicity Economics?

Ergodic Economics shows that finance is based on a 350 years old, incomplete, and erroneous model. To provide recommendations the traditional model requires additional, external, and unreliable inputs such as psychological preferences.

The historical development of the traditional model created a succession of patches around this old, incomplete, and erroneous foundation. Departures or disagreements with the model are labeled as puzzles, paradoxes, anomalies, and irrational behavior.

Ergodic Economics fixes the erroneous foundation, works alongside the traditional model, and transcends its results. Ergodic Economics provides recommendations from inside the model, and resolves the puzzles, paradoxes, anomalies, and irrationalities.
