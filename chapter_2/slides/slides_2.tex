Decision theory as cornerstone of formal economics: models how individuals make decisions.\np
We generalise and formalise treatment of coin tossing game.\np
Axiom: maximise time-average growth rate of wealth.\np
Simple and powerful idea, which removes need for established but epistemologically troublesome techniques.

Gambles will resemble real-world situations.\np

\section{Gambles}
\frame{
\ft{Gamble}
Gamble as fundamental building block of decision theory.\np
Mathematical object resembling real situation whose outcome:
\bi
\item is purely monetary;
\item is uncertain; and
\item occurs over a specified period of time.
\ei\mbox{} 

Example: buying a lottery ticket.\np
Need formal mathematical definition\ldots
}

\frame{
\ft{Definition}
\begin{defn}{Gamble}
A gamble is a pair of random variable, $\gD$, and duration, $\dt$.\\

$\gD$ is called the payout and takes one of $\N$ possible monetary values, $\{\gD_1,\ldots,\gD_N\}$.\\

Payouts are associated with probabilities, $\{\p_1,\ldots,\p_\N\}$, 

where $\sum_{\gi=1}^\N \p_\gi = 1$.\\

Payouts can be positive, associated with monetary gain, or negative, associated with loss.\\

Order them such that $\gD_1<\ldots<\gD_\N$.
\end{defn}
}

\frame{
\ft{Examples}
\underline{Betting on a fair coin}\np
Imagine betting $\$ 10$ on the toss of a fair coin.\np
Model with payouts and probabilities:
\bea
\gD_1 = -\$ 10, &\quad& \p_1 = 1/2;\\
\gD_2 = +\$ 10, &\quad& \p_2 = 1/2.
\eea
Duration: $\dt=2$ seconds.
}

\frame{
\ft{Examples}
\underline{Playing the lottery}\np
Imagine a lottery, where individual pays $\F$ for a ticket which will win jackpot, $\J$, with probability, $\p$.\np
Payouts and probabilities are:
\bea
\gD_1 = -\F,  &\quad& \p_1 = 1-\p;\\
\gD_2 = \J-\F, &\quad& \p_2 = \p.
\eea
Duration: $\dt=1$ week.
}

\frame{
\ft{Examples}
\only<1>{
\underline{Betting at fixed odds}\np
Imagine a bet placed at fixed odds, \eg on a horse race.\np 
Bet $\F$ on \textit{Ito} to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp at odds of 50/1.\np 
\textit{Ito} will win the race with unknown probability, $\p$.\np
Payouts and probabilities are:
\bea
\gD_1 = -\F,  &\quad& \p_1 = 1-\p;\\
\gD_2 = 50\F, &\quad& \p_2 = \p.
\eea
Duration: $\dt=30$ minutes.
}
\only<2>{
\textit{Ito} did not win. (He didn't even run!)\np
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./figs/longchamp.jpg}
}
}
\frame{
\ft{The null gamble}
Another example is the null gamble, in which a payout of zero is received with certainty:
\be
\gD_1=\$0, \quad \p_1=1.
\ee
Useful for our theory as it represents the `no bet' or `do nothing' option.\np
Duration, $\dt$, must be chosen appropriately (often by reference to an alternative gamble).
}

\frame{
\ft{Discrete and continuous gambles}
Gamble as simple but versatile model of uncertain future.\np
Used to model traditional wagers and other economic activities, \eg stock market investments, insurance contracts, derivatives.\np
We presented discrete gamble, where payout has countable (usually small) number of possible outcomes.\np
Extension to continuous gambles is natural.\np
Used to model real-world scenarios with large number of possible outcomes, \eg change in stock price.
}

\frame{
\ft{The gamble problem}
Suppose you must choose between two scenarios modelled as gambles (possibly including the null gamble).\np
\begin{keypts}{Question}
Which should you choose, and why?
\end{keypts}\mbox{}

This is the gamble problem.\np
Central question in decision theory and basis for most of mainstream economics.

\section{Repetition}

\frame{
\ft{Single gamble}
Gambles are mathematical abstractions, not yet connected to our model humans.\np
Relevant to people only in that they affect wealth process, $\x(\t)$.\np 
Single round in isolation (``one-shot game'') uninstructive: says only that $\x(\t+\dt)=\x(\t)+\gD$, a random variable.\np 
Tendency of $\x(\t)$ over time unclear as one time-step not enough for tendency to emerge.\np
Time has no significance in one-shot game. Value of $\dt$ irrelevant to analysis: could be heartbeat or life of universe!
}

\frame{
\ft{Repeated gambles}
Model wealth evolution by repeating gamble over many rounds.\np
We don't believe real-world situations repeat themselves, \eg we don't have to keep betting on \textit{Ito} (thankfully!)\np
Modelling device to extract otherwise invisible tendencies, reflects idea that consequences of decisions unfold over time.\np
Mode of repetition \textbf{not} specified in gamble: separate model component which must be specified.\np
Focus on two modes: \textbf{additive} and \textbf{multiplicative} repetition.
}

\frame{
\ft{Additive repetition}
\begin{defn}{Additive repetition}
Define change in wealth over single round of gamble as
\be
\d \x(\t) \equiv \x(\t+\dt)-\x(\t).
\elabel{DW_def}
\ee
To repeat additively, simply add random payout to wealth at each round, \ie
\be
\d\x(\t) = \gD.
\elabel{DW_add}
\ee
Note that $\d \x$ is a stationary random variable.
\end{defn}
}

\frame{
\ft{Wealth evolution}
Starting at time $\tn$, wealth after $\T$ rounds is
\be
\x(\tn+\T\dt) = \x(\tn) + \sum_{\gtau=1}^\T \gD(\gtau),
\elabel{Wt_add}
\ee
where $\gD(\gtau)$ is realised payout in round $\gtau$.\np
Evolution equation for wealth following noisy additive dynamic.\np 
Note that $\x(\tn+\T\dt)$ is itself a random variable.
}

\frame{
\ft{Example}
\underline{Additive coin toss}\np
Return to first example gamble: $\$ 10$ fair coin toss.\np
Successive bets always $\$ 10$, regardless of wealth.\np
Suppose $\x(\t_0)=\$ 100$, then wealth after $\T$ rounds is
\bea
\x(\t_0+\T\dt) &=& \$ 100 + \$ 10 \gk - \$ 10 (\T-\gk)\\
&=& \$ [100 +  10(2\gk-\T)],
\eea
where $0\leq \gk\leq \T$ is the number of winning tosses.\np
Note: wealth can go negative (no bankruptcy).
}

\frame{
\ft{Multiplicative repetition}
\only<1>{
An alternative is multiplicative repetition.\np
In example, imagine first $\$ 10$ bet not as fixed size but instead as fixed fraction (10\%) of starting wealth ($\$ 100$).\np
Successive bets are for same fraction of wealth, but different monetary amounts.\np
Formalise as follows\ldots
}
\only<2>{
\begin{defn}{Multiplicative repetition}
Express payout, $\gD$, in first round as random wealth multiplier:
\be
\gr \equiv \frac{\x(\t_0)+\gD}{\x(\t_0)}.
\elabel{R_def}
\ee
Repeat gamble by applying multiplier at subsequent rounds:
\be
\x(\t+\dt) = \gr\x(\t).
\ee
\end{defn}
}
}

\frame{
\ft{Wealth evolution}
$\gr$ is a stationary random variable but change in wealth,
\be
\d \x(\t) = (\gr-1)\x(\t),
\elabel{DW_mult_short}
\ee
depends on $\t$ through $\x(\t)$.\np
Wealth after $\T$ rounds of gamble is
\be
\x(\t_0+\T\dt) = \x(\t_0)\prod_{\gtau=1}^\T \gr(\gtau),
\ee
where $\gr(\gtau)$ is realised multiplier in round $\gtau$.
}

\frame{
\ft{Example}
\underline{Multiplicative coin toss}\np
Repeat $\$10$ coin toss multiplicatively.\np
Random multiplier, $\gr$, has two possible possible outcomes:
\bea
\gr_1 = \frac{\$100 - \$10}{\$100} = 0.9, &\quad& \p_1 = 1/2;\\
\gr_2 = \frac{\$100 + \$10}{\$100} = 1.1, &\quad& \p_2 = 1/2.
\eea
Wealth after $\T$ rounds with $\gk$ winning tosses:
\be
\x(\t_0+\T\dt) = \$100\,\,(1.1)^\gk\,(0.9)^{\T-\gk}.
\ee
Note: no possibility of negative wealth or bankruptcy, since individual can lose at most 10\% of wealth in a round.
}

\frame{
\ft{Choose appropriate dynamic}
Imagined mode of repetition not simply matter of taste.\np
Consequence of choice is huge: additive and multiplicative dynamics differ as starkly as linear and exponential functions.\np
Therefore must consider economic situation to be modelled and choose realistic dynamic.\np
\eg Stock price fluctuations tend to be $\propto$ price $\to$ appropriate dynamic is multiplicative.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Growth rates}

\frame{
\ft{Growth rates}
We have linked $\x(\t)$ to the gamble \textit{via} a dynamic.\np
Can now develop decision criterion.\np
Good advice: ``Pick the gamble that will cause your wealth to grow fastest.''\np
To formalise this we need to revisit growth rates.
}

\frame{
\ft{Stationarity}
Previously introduced growth rate, $\g$, as rate of change of strictly increasing function, $\gv(\x)$:
\be
\g(\t,\Dt) \equiv \frac{\D \gv(\x(\t))}{\Dt}.
\elabel{g_def}
\ee
$\gv(\x)$ chosen so that increment, $\D \gv(\x(\t))$, over general time period, $\Dt$, is stationary random variable.\np
$\to$ $\g(\t,\Dt)$ also stationary: \textit{distribution} independent of $t$.\np
Stationarity (\ie statistical irrelevance of measurement time) is crucial $\to$ want distribution of $\g$ to convey robust information about wealth process, not merely when it was sampled.
}

\frame{
\ft{Additive growth rate}
Additive repetition: $\D\x$ already stationary.\np
$\to$ Appropriate mapping is $\gv(\x)=\x$.\np
$\to$ Growth rate under additive repetition is
\be
\g_\text{a}(\t,\Dt) = \frac{\D\x(\t)}{\Dt}.
\elabel{g_add}
\ee
}

\frame{
\ft{Multiplicative growth rate}
Multiplicative repetition: $\D\x$ not stationary $\to$ need mapping $\gv(\x)$ with stationary increment. Note that over one round
\bea
\d\ln \x(\t) &=& \ln \x(\t+\d\t) - \ln \x(\t)\\
&=& \ln \gr\x(\t) - \ln \x(\t)\\
&=& \ln \gr,
\eea
which is stationary because $\gr$ is stationary.\np
$\to$ Appropriate mapping is $\gv(\x)=\ln\x$.\np
$\to$ Growth rate under multiplicative repetition is:
\be
\gm(\t,\Dt) = \frac{\D\ln \x(\t)}{\Dt}.
\elabel{g_mult}
\ee
}

\frame{
\ft{Time-average growth rate}
Distribution of $\g(\t,\Dt)$ depends on $\Dt$.\np
In general, distribution narrows as $\Dt$ increases, converging to a finite number as $\Dt\to\infty$.\np
Repetition over long time exposes tendency of gamble.
\begin{defn}{Time-average growth rate}
Define time-average growth rate as
\be
\gt \equiv \lim_{\Dt\to\infty}\{\g(\t,\Dt)\}.
\ee
\end{defn}
}

\frame{
\ft{Ergodicity}
$\gt$ is growth rate over diverging rounds of gamble:
\be
\gt = \lim_{\T\to\infty} \left\{ \frac{ \gv(\x(\t+\T\dt)) - \gv(\x(\t)) }{\T\dt } \right\}.
\ee
Expand numerator as sum of single-round increments:
\bea
\gt &=& \lim_{\T\to\infty} \left\{ \frac{1}{\T} \sum_{\gtau=1}^\T \frac{ \D \gv(\x(\t+\gtau\dt)) }{ \dt } \right\} \\
&=& \lim_{\T\to\infty} \left\{ \frac{1}{\T} \sum_{\gtau=1}^\T \g(\t+\gtau\dt,\dt) \right\} \;=\; \ave{\g(\t,\dt)}
\eea
by stationarity and independence of successive growth rates.\np
Restatement of ergodic property: time and ensemble averages of ergodic growth rate have same value.
}

\frame{
\ft{Ergodic growth rates}
Equivalences for additive and multiplicative dynamics:
\bea
\gt_\text{a} &=& \lim_{\Dt\to\infty}\left\{\frac{\D\x(\t)}{\Dt}\right\} = \ave{\frac{\D\x(\t)}{\Dt}}; \elabel{g_bar_a}\\
\gt_\text{m} &=& \lim_{\Dt\to\infty}\left\{\frac{\D\ln \x(\t)}{\Dt}\right\} = \ave{\frac{\D\ln \x(\t)}{\Dt}}. \elabel{g_bar_m}
\eea
General equivalence:
\be
\gt = \lim_{\Dt\to\infty}\left\{\frac{\D \gv(\x(\t))}{\Dt}\right\} = \ave{\frac{\D \gv(\x(\t))}{\Dt}}. \elabel{g_bar_gen}
\ee 
Value of $\Dt$ in $\ave{\ }$ immaterial. Gamble duration, $\dt$, often used.\np
No special interpretation of $\ave{\g}$. Just happens to coincide with quantity of interest, $\gt$.
}

\frame{
\ft{Scalars}
\only<1>{
General remarks on story so far.\np
Start with high-dimensional mathematical object: gamble.\np
Add dynamic: instructions for how wealth evolves when gamble repeated.\np
Collapse this information to a scalar (single number), $\gt$, which summarises effect of gamble on wealth.\np
Scalars can be ranked unequivocally $\to$ clear decision criterion.\np
Hard to devise for high-dimensional objects, \eg return distributions\ldots

\section{Decision axiom}

\frame{
\ft{Model rationale}
Model rationale for deciding between gambles: maximise $\gt$ for the specified mode of repetition.\np
In other words, model humans choose gamble which, if repeated indefinitely, causes wealth to grow fastest.\np
Indefinite repetition as conceptual device or thought experiment to elicit tendency of gamble.\np
In real world a particular choice between gambles may only occur once.\np
But also true that real decisions followed by many others.
}

\frame{
\ft{Plausibility and parsimony}
In model this decision rule outperforms all others in the long run $\to$ plausible logical basis.\np
Where model approximates real world, expect rationale to approximate real decisions.\np 
Rationale is parsimonious, based on a single robust quantity derived from minimal model components (gamble, dynamic).\np
No arbitrary or unquantifiable human psychological factors.
}

\frame{
\ft{Axiom}
Nevertheless, decision criterion has status of \textit{axiom}: it is asserted as premise of model.\np
Generates model world where certain behaviours observed.\np
Hope is for model world to resemble real world, but you may disagree.\np
Other decision axioms possible, \eg classical decision theory based on axiom that humans maximise expected utility.
}

\frame{
\ft{Algorithm}
\only<1>{
Decision criterion expressible as set of instructions.\np
Denote by $\mbox{}^{(\m)}$ quantities relating to $\m^\text{th}$ available gamble.\np
Each gamble specified by:
\bi
\item random payout, $\gD^{(\m)}$; and
\item duration, $\dt^{(\m)}$.
\ei\mbox{}

Common dynamic for all gambles.
}
\only<2>{
\begin{keypts}{Growth-optimal decision algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Specify $\gD^{(\m)}$ and $\dt^{(\m)}$ for gambles offered;
\item Specify wealth dynamic, \ie relationship between $\d\x(\t)$, $\x(\t)$, and $\gD$;
\item Determine function, $\gv(\x)$, whose increments are stationary random variables under dynamic;
\item Determine time-average growth rates, $\gt^{(\m)}$, by taking time or ensemble averages of ergodic growth rates, $\g^{(\m)}(\t,\Dt)$;
\item Choose gamble, $\m$, with the largest $\gt^{(m)}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{keypts}
}
}

\frame{
\ft{Example setup}
Example decisions are between two gambles, \ie $\m\in\{1,2\}$.\np
Decisions between three or more gambles straightforward extensions.\np
Often one option is the null gamble, which trivially has zero growth rate.\np
Then question posed is whether other gamble preferable to doing nothing, \ie accept or decline?\np
}

\frame{
\ft{Example game}
Apply decision algorithm to original coin toss game.\np
Starting wealth $\x(\tn)>\$ 0$, duration $\dt$, random payout:
\bea
\gD^{(1)}_1 = -0.4\x(\t_0), &\quad& \p^{(1)}_1 = 1/2; \\
\gD^{(1)}_2 = 0.5\x(\t_0), &\quad& \p^{(1)}_2 = 1/2.
\eea
Note that payouts $\gD^{(1)}_\gi$ are fixed monetary amounts, expressed here as fractions of $\x(\t_0)$.\np
Choice is between coin toss game and null gamble:
\be
\gD^{(2)}_1 = \$0, \quad \p^{(2)}_1 = 1.
\ee
Analyse under additive and multiplicative repetition.

\frame{
\ft{Example}

\underline{Additive repeated coin toss}\np

\x^{(2)}(t_0+\T\dt) &=& \x(\t_0).
\eea
$\gv(\x)=\x$, so growth rates per unit time are:
\bea
\g_\text{a}^{(1)}(\t) \;=\; \frac{\x^{(1)}(\t+\T\dt) - \x(\t_0)}{\T\dt} &=& \frac{1}{\T}\sum_{\gtau=1}^\T \frac{\gD^{(1)}(\gtau)}{\dt}; \elabel{g1_add}\\
\g_\text{a}^{(2)}(\t) \;=\; \frac{\x^{(2)}(\t+\T\dt) - \x(\t_0)}{\T\dt} &=& \$ 0.

}
\only<2>{
Trivially $\gt_\text{a}^{(2)}=\$0$ per unit time. For coin toss,

\eea
per unit time. This is positive, so $\gt_\text{a}^{(1)}>\gt_\text{a}^{(2)}$.\np 
\textbf{Individual accepts coin toss under additive dynamics.}
}
}

\frame{
\ft{Realism}
Decision rule under additive repetition is to maximise $\ave{\gD/\dt}$, \ie which is rate of change of expected wealth.\np
This coincides under additive dynamic with time-average growth rate.\np
See later that real people usually don't maximise $\ave{\gD/\dt}$.\np 
No great shock: additive repetition without bankruptcy is hardly most realistic model of wealth evolution.\np
Try multiplicative repetition instead.
}

\frame{

\g_\text{m}^{(2)}(\t) = \frac{\ln \x^{(2)}(\t+T\dt) - \ln \x(\t_0)}{\T\dt} &=& 0
\eea
Trivially $\gt_\text{m}^{(2)}=0$ per unit time. For the coin toss,
\bea
\gt_\text{m}^{(1)} = \ave{\frac{\ln \gr^{(1)}}{\dt}} = \frac{\ln0.9}{2\dt},
\eea
per unit time. This is negative, so $\gt_\text{m}^{(1)}<\gt_\text{m}^{(2)}$.\np
\textbf{Decline coin toss under multiplicative dynamics.}

Decision rule under multiplicative repetition is to maximise
\be
\ave{\frac{\ln \gr}{\dt}} = \ave{\frac{\ln(\x(\t_0)+\gD)-\ln \x(\t_0)}{\dt}},

which coincides with the time-average growth rate.\np
For choice of gambles in example, get \textit{opposite} of decision under additive repetition.\np

Can also present multiplicative repetition without the logarithmic mapping.\np
Wealth after $\T$ rounds (with $\gk$ winning tosses) is

where

\only<2>{
$\gr_\T^{(1)}$ is a random variable but it converges to

\gr_\infty^{(1)} \equiv \lim_{\T\to\infty}\left\{\gr_\T^{(1)}\right\} = (0.6)^{1/2}(1.5)^{1/2} = \sqrt{0.9},
\ee
since $\gk/\T\to1/2$ as $\T\to\infty$ (fair coin).\np
$\gr_\infty^{(1)}<1$ so wealth decays over time $\to$ coin toss declined.\np

\begin{keypts}{Expected-utility decision algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Specify $\gD^{(\m)}$ and $\dt^{(\m)}$ for gambles offered;

\ave{\gr_\gu}^{(\m)}=\ave{\frac{\gu\left(\x+\gD^{(\m)}\right)-\gu(\x)}{\dt^{(\m)}}};

Our decision theory and mainstream utility theory have different conceptual foundations but similar maximands:
\be
\gt = \ave{\frac{\D\gv(\x)}{\Dt}}; \quad \ave{\gr_\gu} = \ave{\frac{\D\gu(\x)}{\Dt}}.
\ee
Stationarity mapping, $\gv(\x)$, depends on wealth dynamic.\np
Utility function, $\gu(\x)$, depends on psychological attitude to risk.\np
Approaches mathematically equivalent if we identify $\gv$ with $\gu$.\np
But suspect debates easier to settle empirically for dynamic than for psychology $\to$ better science.\np
}

\frame{
\ft{Discussion}
Utility theory consistent with $\gt$ maximisation for matching pairs of dynamic and utility function.\np 
But utility theory is a poorly constrained model, because infinitely many admissible $\gu$ and, therefore, $\ave{\gr_\gu}$.\np
Our approach requires dynamic to be specified $\to$ unique $\gv$, $\gt$.\np
$\gv=\ln\x$ for multiplicative repetition.\np
$\gu=\ln\x$ most widely used utility function.\np
Coincidence? Or humans evolved to make growth-optimal decisions in multiplicative environments?

\ft{Predictive failure -- reason}

Good model of decisions under additive repetition.\np

Insurance important and ubiquitous economic transaction, which can be modelled as gamble.\np
But in expected-wealth paradigm, buying insurance only rational at prices at which irrational to sell:
\begin{enumerate}
\item To be viable, insurer must charge at least expected value of possible claims (``net 
premium'').
\item So buyer must be willing to pay more than net premium.
\item In expected-wealth paradigm, buyer should decline contract priced at more than 
net premium.
\item Therefore insurance contracts should not exist.
\end{enumerate}

\ft{Puzzle}
In this picture, insurance only ever beneficial to one party.\np
Anti-symmetry: expected value of one side's gain = expected value of other side's loss.\np
Puzzle: insurance contracts are observed to exist. Why?\np
Classical resolutions: utility theory (\ie psychology) and asymmetric information (\ie deception).\np New resolution: contracts exist with range of prices that increase $\gtm$ for both buyer and seller.\np

\item probability ship will be lost, $\p=0.05$;

\item voyage time, $\dt=1$ month.

Insurer with wealth $\x_\text{ins}=\$1,000,000$ offers to insure voyage for fee, $\F=\$1,800$.\np
If ship lost, insurer pays $\gL=\G+\C$ for ship and lost profit.
